The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York . 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation . Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \\\"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\\\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'\",\n          \"Eerie footage has emerged showing a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO. The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the  cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace. The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the\\u00a0phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air. Mysterious: The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.\",\n          \"Arrested: Doug Hughes was put under arrest for his gyro-copter stunt and charged with\\u00a0operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace . The postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the U.S. Capitol is facing two criminal charges. But he's being released from federal custody to return to Florida. Doug Hughes made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington on Thursday. That's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the Capitol's West Lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the National Mall. He was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace. Hughes said it was a political protest. Hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in Tampa starting next week. In a soft voice, Hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,'\\u00a0as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why. Johnson said it's too soon to say whether Wednesday's incident should prompt changes in security procedures. 'I want to know all the facts before I reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future,' he said. But lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security, especially amid revelations that the pilot, Florida postal worker Doug Hughes, was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago. The agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat, said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Cummings spoke Thursday with the Secret Service director. 'I think that there's absolutely a gap, and it's a very dangerous gap, with regard to our airspace,' Cummings said. 'I don't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere. Suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle? That could have been a major catastrophe.' How'd it happen? Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . Approach: The small gyro-copter (circled in red) lands on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington as members of the public walk by. The stunt hasn't cost him his freedom, yet, but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial . Johnson said the Secret Service passed along the information from the interview with Hughes, who was to appear in court Thursday afternoon, to 'all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.' House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the incident 'stunning.' 'What safeguards can we use? We don't want to be a place where we're saying `This is an iron-clad Capitol.' And have such restrictions on people having access to it,' Pelosi told reporters. 'Nonetheless, we have to ensure the safety of those people.' The tiny, open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone, but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, right up to the Capitol. Hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and deliver letters to all 535 members of Congress on the topic. 'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. 'And so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this, but then again, you don't want to overreact, either.' Still, lawmakers questioned why, if authorities had been in touch with Hughes, no action was taken to stop him. Practice run: Doug Hughes flies his gyrocopter near the Wauchula Municipal Airport in Wauchula, Florida prior to his 'insane' stunt on Wednesday . Before\\u00a0Doug Hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the U.S. Capitol grounds, he blogged about his intention to undertake the 'non-violent demonstration.' Though, it may have been a demonstration years in the making. In a post dated September 2013 on the democracyclub.org, a writer called Tampadoug47 wrote: . Let me say first \\u2013 this is a non-violent demonstration. I have no intention of hurting anyone \\u2013 I have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone, including me. There is no way I can prevent over-reaction by the authorities, but I have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows. When I took off, I was over an hour away from the no-fly zone. The demonstration is about restoring democracy. Corruption in Washington DC has robbed the US citizens of the representative government that is our birthright. Polls show that the public is aware of the problem and VERY concerned, but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality. As a result of this flight, two things will happen. (I hope.) First, we\\u2019re going to change the narrative \\u2013 the story. Voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot-button issues and come together on a single issue. Honest government. Congress won\\u2019t start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business. Lobbyists, Special Interests, Unions. We have to make this happen. The political parties won\\u2019t. Congress sure won\\u2019t. Lobbyists love the status quo. The mainstream media (not the local media) is making a financial killing with mega-elections. It\\u2019s up to us. Second, in every Congressional race in 2016, I want every candidate to take a stand on corruption. After this flight, we\\u2019re going to define exactly what reform means \\u2013 set a written standard \\u2013 and it\\u2019s that standard which candidates will have to endorse. Or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position. The candidate who only wants to talk \\u2018reform\\u2019 but won\\u2019t endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform. That may be in the primary or the general election. Giving you a choice is our job. The clear choice, establishment or reform, will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races. You get to choose (That\\u2019s your job as a voter.) but for the first time in decades, you will have a meaningful choice. What do I want from you? Look over your options on the previous screen or the \\u2018Honor Roll\\u2019 on the sidebar to the right. Rootstrikers or Wolf PAC or Represent.US. My favorite group isn\\u2019t listed there \\u2013 it\\u2019s my own startup group:\\u2018The Civilist Papers\\u2018. Find a group (or groups) that you are comfortable with and sign up. We\\u2019re not after money \\u2013 we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed. Protest flight: Doug Hughes took off from an undisclosed location in Washington D.C. and landed his gyro-copter on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . 'My concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response,' said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. 'These small aircraft or UAV devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage, so that's something we're taking a look at,' McCaul said, adding he might hold hearings on the issue. Cummings and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media. Johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over Washington, D.C., federal buildings and monuments. 'We've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission,' he said. He said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask, 'What's a gyrocopter?' It's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar. Unlike most larger aircraft, a gyrocopter doesn't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft, its altitude and heading. Even without a transponder, radar can detect 'primary targets' - planes, flocks of birds, rain and other objects. But how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors. The landing on the Capitol grounds 'just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier. It's very hard to hermetically seal airspace,' said John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics professor.

'obviously we want to finish a race, but seeing improvement in pace was much more important,' said button. 'yes, we both had failures, but i'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end. 'to be able to race other cars, and see the red bulls until a long way into the race, was good. 'we would probably have been 20 seconds behind them. i know they're not quick, but that is a good step forward for us. button returns to the mclaren garage after retiring during the race at the sepang circuit . 'right now we're comparing ourselves with the force indias, saubers and lotuses. 'we were quicker than force india; the sauber was on the same sort of pace, and the lotus wasn't that much quicker. 'fighting with the pack is important for me. it's what i enjoy and hopefully race by race we'll start picking them off.' despite the positives, button acknowledges the entire team, including honda, 'still has a long way to go'. british driver button in action before he retired from the malaysian grand prix . button added: 'we need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us, and we still have a lot to do with the power unit, but our basic car is good. 'if you look at our high-speed pace, compared to the force india and sauber, then we are much stronger. 'so we're moving in the right direction, and i'm already surprised we are racing cars. it's great to see.' part of the reasoning behind mclaren's improvement in malaysia, in comparison to australia, was the high temperatures which suited the car. mclaren driver fernando alonso (left) drives ahead of team-mate button in kuala lumpur . button appreciates the cooler air in shanghai could have an effect. the 35-year-old said: 'there is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature. 'that could mean any progress we make doesn't necessarily translate to a lap-time benefit. 'but there is definitely progress being made, and it's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards. 'it'll be fascinating to see how much change we can effect over the forthcoming races.'\",\n          \"munster have signed new zealand international francis saili on a two-year deal. utility back saili, who made his all blacks debut against argentina in 2013, will move to the province later this year after the completion of his 2015 contractual commitments. the 24-year-old currently plays for auckland-based super rugby side the blues and was part of the new zealand under-20 side that won the junior world championship in italy in 2011. saili's signature is something of a coup for munster and head coach anthony foley believes he will be a great addition to their backline. francis saili has signed a two-year deal to join munster and will link up with them later this year . 'we are really pleased that francis has committed his future to the province,' foley told munster's official website. 'he is a talented centre with an impressive skill-set and he possesses the physical attributes to excel in the northern hemisphere. 'i believe he will be a great addition to our backline and we look forward to welcoming him to munster.' saili has been capped twice by new zealand \\u00a0and was part of the under 20 side that won the junior championship in 2011 . saili, who joins all black team-mates dan carter, ma'a nonu, conrad smith and charles piutau in agreeing to ply his trade in the northern hemisphere, is looking forward to a fresh challenge. he said: 'i believe this is a fantastic opportunity for me and i am fortunate to move to a club held in such high regard, with values and traditions i can relate to from my time here in the blues.

'sharon was the kindest, most loving sister. all she wanted to do was find her soulmate,' he said. 'she wore her heart on her sleeve. she was kind and caring - a lovely woman.' ms winters, who was unable to work due to depression, started going on dating websites in 2013. father-of-seven mr robinson disapproved, fearing that men were taking advantage of his susceptible younger sister. he said: 'i used to check up on her all the time, i was incredibly protective. sharon winters was lonely and felt that kevin hawke was the only man who wanted her; sharon, pictured with her mother ann, had very low self-esteem, says her brother stephen . 'one day when i was taking her over some shopping, i noticed she was looking brighter, and she told me she'd met someone online. 'she showed me their messages to one another and i was horrified. they were very sexual and he'd even sent her pictures of his privates. 'i feared he was just after one thing, and told her as much. she said that chatting to men online made her feel good about herself. 'she got frustrated by my disapproval, so i dropped the subject. i just begged her to meet these dates in busy places.' however, ms winters would often invite men she met online back to her home, meeting them there face-to-face for the first time. mr robinson said: 'for all her amazing qualities, my sister lacked common sense. she'd been bullied throughout childhood and felt like she was worthless, that she was unlovable. 'my wife helen and i tried to build up her self-esteem, and our children loved spending time with their aunty. stephen is trying to raise awareness of the dangers of online dating after his sister lost her life at the hands of a man she met on the internet . stephen robinson describes his sister as a 'lonely heart who just wanted love' 'but at the end of the day she just wanted someone she could share her life with.' ms winters thought she'd found that someone when she met hawke, a chef, on a dating website. mr robinson said: 'from the off she was smitten. she called me up after meeting him for the first time, saying it was love and that he was moving in. 'i was concerned, but didn't say anything to sharon. i knew it would upset her. instead my wife and i arranged a dinner with the new couple, only kevin didn't show. 'we rescheduled for the next day and the same thing happened again. by now i was also hearing rumours that kevin was being aggressive towards sharon, so i pleaded with her to end it. 'all she said was, \\\"no one else wants me'\\\", and it was heartbreaking to hear.' mr robinson's pleas fell on deaf ears, and ms winters stopped talking to her brother. it would be the last time they'd ever speak. he said: 'we had a bit of an argument about it, and three days later i called her to apologise. 'she didn't pick up her phone, which was odd, so i decided to head over to see her. i quickly checked the football scores before i left.' as mr robinson checked his local news website, he also saw a news story so devastating it would change his life forever. he saw a picture of his sister's home with the headline: 'a 39-year-old woman has been found dead in her flat.' he said: 'i felt sick to my stomach. i called the police who told me the news, sharon was dead. 'i knew immediately who had killed her. we were eventually told kevin hawke had called the police after killing my sister, and had been charged with her murder. 'as we waited for the trial i planned sharon's funeral. we had a butterfly theme as they were sharon's favourite \\u2013 delicate and beautiful, just like her.' during the trial at liverpool crown court mr robinson heard how the couple had been rowing over what to watch on tv. an alcoholic, hawke had drunk 15 pints of lager and a bottle of vodka. stephen, pictured here with his daughters sophie (left) and ellie, on a trip to sea world, begged sharon to meet online dates in a busy public place rather than at her house . mr robinson said: 'it was horrendous to listen to. apparently sharon had begged for her life and held her hands up to protect herself. if only i'd been there. 'he was savage, her injuries were unbelievable. he'd even ripped through her ribcage. 'when the judge sentenced him to life in prison it was justice of sorts, but all i really want is my beloved sister back. 'after the case we went to get sharon's belongings, and you could still see blood on the walls even through the flat had been cleaned. it must have been a bloodbath.' now mr robinson is trying to raise awareness about domestic violence as well as letting women know the dangers of online dating. 'i hope by telling sharon's story, people will be more wary about who they are chatting to online and make sure, if they do meet up, it's in a busy public place. 'kevin was aggressive towards sharon before he killed her, and i wish she'd gone for help. 'instead my poor sister suffered in silence, with tragic consequences.'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
